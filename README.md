## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

In this notebook we are classifying words into their **parts of speech** and labeling them accordingly is known as **part-of-speech tagging**, or simply **POS-tagging**.

- What is the background of your project?

The process of classifying words into their **parts of speech** and labeling them accordingly is known as **part-of-speech tagging**, or simply **POS-tagging**.
The NLTK library has a number of corpora which contains word and its POS tag. The following table provide information about each tag:

- Business Problem Statement:

In this notebook we are classifying words into their **parts of speech** and labeling them accordingly is known as **part-of-speech tagging**, or simply **POS-tagging**.We will be preprocessing the data, applying techniques such as Vanilla RNN, Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM and Model Evauation

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The NLTK library has a number of corpora which contains word and its POS tag. The following table provide information about each tag:

## Conclusions
- We could do POS Tagging with RNN techniques.
